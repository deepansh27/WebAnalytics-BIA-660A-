One of the finest Indian stuff I've had in the upper east side, perfect for the price and you could experience like all the flavors from India within one buffet! Very pleasant experience! Definitely recommend!
Great spot for lunch near Mount Sinai Hospital. Lunch buffet had diverse options, including empanadas, salads, and pasta, and comes with a bottle of water and naan. Owner is super friendly and even gave us some free samples today.
I've been going to the original Bawarchi for the past 3 years and have always enjoyed their food. When they opened their new place closer to my office I was ecstatic and the quality of the food was the still the same! As an Indian they have the best tasting Indian food I've had from any restaurant. Their saag paneer and butter chicken are my personal two favorites!
