Only option we had staying at nearby hotel  for Chinese delivery.  Ordered Beef with SnowPeas and got Beef with bell peppers with two pieces of snow peas. This place tried to save money by mixing in other greens (bell peppers). Because I hate bell peppers, I ordered a dish with snow peas. So I couldn't eat it.  Lo Mein noodle dish was mushy angel hair pasta. Made me wonder if the real Asian was cooking these dishes.  Fried rice was the only OKAY dish we could eat.  Don't waste your money. Try somewhere else.
Placed an order with Seamless. An hour and five minutes later, called to see where my food was. I was told that my food would arrive in ten minutes. Called ten minutes later and was told that they never got my order at all and then they hung up on me. I'd love to be able to review the food but since it never showed up, I'll leave my review based on customer service.
