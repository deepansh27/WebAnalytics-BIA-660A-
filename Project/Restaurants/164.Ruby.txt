Can't even comment on the food because we weren't even able to eat there. I would give them 0 stars if I could. We called 3 days in advance to make a reservation for Saturday night. They recorded the reservation and said can't wait to see you. We show up Saturday night for our reservation and there was a private event going on, which we were not aware of. Meaning, we could not have dinner at the restaurant for the night we made a reservation for. The owner could not have cared less - he started to grill us about who we spoke to, didn't apologize, said he had the sign up on the restaurant so we should've known. I don't know how we are supposed to know a sign is up indicating a private party is taking place when we called the restaurant to make the reservation. I don't think I've ever been treated like that by a restaurant before, especially after they've made a mistake. The owner didn't apologize at all for the inconvenience. It was an awful experience and we would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Loved the food here - went for lunch buffet. Also awesome ambience. Special shout-out to TJ for being a great host. Definitely coming back here soon!
Ordered takeout from here and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Had the chicken tikka and saag paneer and both were good. Those are staple Indian dishes that i feel can tell you a lot about an Indian restaurant. Looking forward to trying other dishes and glad to have more variety in Great Neck.
