This place is absolutely awful. I ordered four items and they gave me two items that were wrong. I ordered a lamb curry and a chicken tikka masala and my chicken was nowhere to be found, I received two lamb curries instead. I don't really eat curry and I had to scoff it down and it gave me major abdominal pains. The entire order was listed on the receipt so I don't understand how they could have possibly gotten the order wrong. They probably didn't have anymore of the dishes I ordered and just gave me other random stuff instead without informing me. What upset me most was that I ordered two beef kabobs and they gave me two chicken ones instead! The prices for the two weren't even the same! It was a $1 extra for the beef and I got a chicken one which cost less. Complete bullsh*t and they can be assured that I will NEVER go back.. The naan was rubbery and cold and had a weird smell to it. The lamb curry was tough and the curry was very watery. The chicken kabobs were cold and tasted dry like paper. Please save your money and go elsewhere! This place is horrendous, complete garbage.
I have been eating here since I was a little kid. I first starting coming here with my cousin to watch cricket games. The place has been cleaned up drastically over the years. Before it was completely filthy, but thats over now. The food has always been absolutely amazing. The goat curry is by far my favorite, followed a close second by the chicken on skewers and of course naan. The yogurt sauce they make is also of the best I've ever had. For an extremely affordable and delicious meal, I suggest you go here.
