They just opened this cart at Ditmars Blvd and 31st Street in Astoria. Lucky me! Believe it or not, it's hard to find good, authentic Indian food in most parts of Astoria, so the timing of this cart's arrival is perfect. While I waited for my dish to be prepped (chicken curry, it was awesome), the proprietor who was on the sidewalk holding court offered me and another customer a free samosa. Holy crispy delight, Batman. That was one delicious samosa. Prices are fair, comparable to other trucks/carts at that intersection. But the food is on point. And the menu apparently rotates with different specials each day. Made a second visit tonight just for a quick samosa snack. They didn't have the chicken samosa I wanted, so I tried a veggie samosa and some kind of patty-shaped crispy, fried cake thingy that knocked my socks off. I'm afraid I have a new addiction. Thanks a bunch, Mysttik Masaala. Only drawback is that the guy tonight said they will only have naan (which is delicious, don't get me wrong), but not paratha. And that makes me sad. But hey, life isn't perfect.
Soooo good!! Everyone go check out the food for a quick Indian bite! Â From samosas to dinner platters, all delicious! I had the chicken tikka naan roll where the guy hooked my friend and I up with some amazing samples as well YUM!!! His service was amazing as well. Will def go back.
Delicious and addictive. I always get a vegetarian platter with the Biryani overload. The guy serving you food always greets you with a friendly smile. Highly recommended!
This cart is SO good! There is hardly any good Indian food in this neighborhood (Astoria), and I am so happy it's here now. I had a fabulous platter last night that I am just now finishing, because it was big enough for two meals. Super spicy veggie vindaloo with daal and rice and a few little toppings. HIGHLY recommend.
