I rarely rate on decor but this place is redonkulous. From the outer facade and door to, well basically every single inch of this place they are going for it in a way that almost no one goes for it anymore. props to Lakruwana, particularly for the bathroom quotes painted on wood featuring phrases like "THERE IS NO FIRE LIKE LUST" AND "THE LIAR FALLS INTO HELL".Also the food is good. I liked my kotthu roti a bit less than at Sigiri but it was still flavorful, though not quite as pleasingly chewy. The lamprais was pretty tasty as well. It's my first lamprais so I've got no comps, but I enjoyed the mix of flavors and while I wish the curry was a bit spicier, places always worry you can't handle it.
Great food,excellent atmosphere. This place is like a museum,friendly staff great food . Buffet has a great selection. You should come down to Bay Street and check this place out it is well worth it. Price is reasonable friendly staff comfortable and pleasant .
Been here several times for the sunday buffet but have had there regular menu as well. Amazing food and great service. LOVE the mango moose but all desserts are great. Quiet enough atmosphere along with tons of crazy decor of Sri Lanka all over the walls! Will def go back soon!
tasty buffet, everything tastes like a perfect barbeque.  Desserts are perfect too - mango pudding, coconut pudding.  worth a trip to Staten Island.  Go for a walk on the boardwalk nearby and walk it off for a perfect day in Staten Island.
I am never gonna go to Sri Lanka cause the decor and food at this spot have saved myself a plane ticket.  Not to insult the country of Sri Lanka, but if you have never tried Sri Lankan food, this IS the experience.  My pick on the menu is the lamprais.  Pick your choice of meat, I opted for the beef, and get ready to enjoy the culinary magic with a multitude of flavors.  Be prepared though, you've been forwarned: The food is spicy.  Also, make sure to try a fish ball- deeelicious!!!Weekend alert: they have a buffet.  I hate buffets.  Stick to normal-sized portions.
HIDDEN GEM in staten island. Never knew this place existed and was glad to find it on a thrilllist top 10. Decor: Cool cool setup. Feel like your not in Staten Island and that your in another world. Very cultured environment and very peaceful when I went as well. I was the only one eating so it felt like my gf and I had the whole place to ourselves which means plenty of pics lolFood: There is a buffet during the weekend that is the most bang for your buck however I went on a weekday night which the prices were around $9-$14 each which was fine with the portion we received. Get the lamprias for that instagram pic/clip lol! It is very tasty and very filling as well. Staff: The guy who owns the spot was very accommodating from the start. He gave off the same vibe as the restaurant, very chill and peaceful. Tip well!Overall: If you want Sri Lanken food this is it! If you want to impress your date with a new cool decor this is it! If you want to take cool pics with tiki menu this is it!
Amazing spot. 1) This is probably the best Sri Lankan restaurant in NYC. 2) The weekend buffets are amazing. When I went, they pork curry and egg curry were fantastic. 3) Will be back.
I don't like buffets and I've never had a reason or desire to go to Staten Island. So this place is defying all the odds.Came to Lakruwana because there is a disturbing lack of Sri Lankan food in the other boroughs. I heard there is a $14 buffet which sounds too good to be true but is both good and totally true.First of all, this restaurant is a trip. You walk inside and it's like you're not in the Western Hemisphere, let alone Staten Island. I counted no less than 5 Buddha statues alone. The chairs are about 5 feet tall and look more like long limber boats than seats. All the food is hanging out in clay pots instead of catering hall trays. So ambiance wise, it's special to say the least.The food is pretty stellar. I tried a shrimp kotthu roti, which is on the menu and a great staple dish. But I really came here for the weekend buffet. On Saturdays and Sundays, if you choose, you get access to all those wonderful clay pots filled to the brim with rices, curries, vegetables, and deviled chicken and pork. If you're a vegetarian you're going to have a great time - the standout dishes to me were all vegetables, including the eggplant which is almost like a marmalade, the green bean and lentil curries, the sambols and the coconut kale. So much flavor and heat, so little room in my rapidly filled up stomach. There's also a dessert bar which includes mango and chocolate mousse, and a caramel flan which was quite tasty and a nice addition to the buffet line up. Like I said, I don't like buffets because they take away both your money and your dignity, but I left here with plenty of both. If you've never had Sri Lankan food, or if you're hesitant to try it, scrounge up $14 in cash and make your way to this corner of Staten Island so they can convince you to love it like I do.
Beautiful decor. Nice service. Very authentic food. The curries n the other courses are so different than other Resturant s.The utensils were interesting. The menu is on terracotta handicraft..
The best, most beautiful food experience I have had in a while. This restaurant is like a treasure trove of Sri Lanka and the place is decorated so intentionally that it is like a museum by itself. FOODIES: IF YOU DO NOT COME HERE, YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES OF YOUR LIFE.In addition, the owner was the man who served us, so we were able to get a very knowledgeable person to teach us about the food, the culture and the art he keeps in his beautiful abode. Everything we had was GREAT and I will never, ever forget the moment I got my meal-- it was like unwrapping a holiday or birthday gift. Just go, already. Check out my pictures + videos. I can't capture this experience in words. Love, Renee Rises
Wow! What a find! This is my new favorite restaurant! I came here with my daughter, who goes to Wagner College. The neighborhood is a little gritty, but filled with beautiful murals. When we stepped through the doors we were met with an international experience bar none. Some might think the Sri Lankan decor is over the top; I think it is just perfect! I don't know who decorated this restaurant but it transported me to another part of the world. Even the bathroom is a sight to behold. The food? Amazing! Bursting with flavors, a feast for the palate, with ample variety! Recommended from the buffet are the pineapple curry, the cassava, the eggplant, the pork curry and the red rice. The desserts (mousses) are so yummy, too! You will not regret coming here and when you do come, you will want to return again and again.
LOVE this place!I would rate 5 stars if they were open consistent hours (and longer hours), and if they also had an option for delivery.Otherwise it's such an adorable place with amazing food!! Def a gem in Staten Island (and NYC for that matter). Beautiful, intricate decor that anyone will appreciate and you won't see just anywhere- especially in Staten Island. Great ambiance, and delicious.**They don't serve alcohol but they let you bring your own
Best buffet in all of NYC. Worth the 20 mile traffic clogged drive from northern Queens. The decor is really unique, you can tell the friendly proprietors have put their heart and soul into it. I'm excited to explore the Sri Lankan Cultural Museum that they're creating. The food is the most authentic Sri Lankan you'll get outside of the country--subtle blends of coconut, heat, and perfectly curried meats and veggies. I adore this place!
Yum!!! Their buffet is worth going to Staten Island for. Delicious tastes and combinations of food.
Such an amazing discovery! I was originally planning to come to another restaurant however it was still closed by the time I got there; Yelp led me here. Sri Lanka food was something I have never tried yet always craving about before. Buffet was served during weekends so I got to try each different piece of it. Highly being influenced by Indian food, Sri Lanka food indeed offered lots of curry sauces - made by eggplant, by pineapple, by kale, everything. They even had egg curry! Haven't yet satisfied, I went ahead and served myself homemade pudding with mango and gooseberry flavors, both were fantastic without going extremely sweet.Inside decor was so Sri Lanka-like, with elephants everywhere, even for the teapot! You cannot miss this place if you prefer something exotic and would like to embrace changes.
I've now been here twice, once for the regular menu and once for the buffet. Both are excellent.
Great food. Kind and fast service.  Wonderfully fun decor.I asked for a black curry to go with my strong hoppers and it was no problem and totally delicious.
Overwrought, bombastic, gilded and overdecorated - the atmosphere of this over the top Sri Lankan restaurant has to be experienced. My delicious lentil coconut nut soup was served in a coconut bowl on a wooden triangular stand. The buffet simmered with delectable surprises like pineapple curry, pork curry (really? I've never had Pork in Indian cuisine...) and salted dried peppers to add some zing to your dish. Still the chicken dish stood out, and my only complaint was (hate me for this) I like my pork dishes not too fatty and my chicken dishes boneless. Then it would be perfect. Sorry for the prima-Donna-ness. Even the washroom was decked out and over the top. I loved it! Green gooseberry mousse for dessert enticed my curiosity. There's a unnoticeable stairway down to the Sri Lankan exhibit below that showcases some wondrous, sometimes gaudy, but nevertheless fabulous artifacts from this curious part of the world. Definitely worth a visit between trips to the buffet!
Incredible lunch buffet on the weekends! The decor and all the details make it for quite the experience.
A place with fantastic ambience and earthly food, was well worth the trip to Staten island.
Had an amazing meal here with a friend who is half Sri Lankan and she said it tasted just like her grandmother's. The restaurant itself is designed in such a cool way, but the food is the showstopper - every single thing super delicious. We had the Saturday buffet at $13.95 and also ordered hoppers and lamprie. So good that we couldn't stop talking about it for days.
I love restaurants that upon entering make you feel as if you've been immersed in another environment or country entirely. This is definitely one of those!!!! Every aspect of the ambiance and decor is eye catching. The menu itself - I've never seen anything like it - you'd have to go to see what I mean ;-). The food is both affordable and incredibly tasty! - the best, yet often challenging combination to find in a good restaurant. Checking out Lakruwana is a MUST, and I'm sure it won't be your last visit!!
I really like the food here, but beware.. its very spicy!  the buffet is great but some dishes are too spicy.  But a nice variety. Its decorated beautifully also.. its always very crowded when I've been there, but I always go on weekends.
Fantastic restaurant: conveniently located close to Staten Island Ferry and ball park (ideal pre-game meal or lunch spot visiting from Manhattan).Delightful staff, most attentive and accommodating.Delicious food and incredible ambience in the restaurant. The decor was so carefully done and very authentic. Most of our party did the buffet, and loved it, but I was super keen to try the kottu roti - fantastic flavor.Can't wait to come back next time!
I came here twice. Once for dinner and once for brunch.Atmosphere: what can I say that no one has said?! Its all true. This place is truly unique and beautiful. No detail has been overlooked when it comes to decor. Food: I have never had Sri Lankan food before so I don't have anything to compare it to. For dinner I had the lamb rotti. It was delicious but a tad bit salty. I had the sampler appetizer. My husband really liked it but I wasn't as big of a fan. I thought it was going to be a crunchy and deep fried vegetable roll. Instead, it was mushy and soft. I know it's weird to have a preference over texture, but thats typically what I go for. The Brunch buffet was definitely not as good as my dinner. The reason being, the food was not held at the proper temperature. It was either barely warm or cold. Also some of the options just didnt appeal to me. For instance all the desserts offered were puddings. I HATE pudding. Additionally, the rest of the main buffet dishes were 3 different variety's of rice. I do not eat rice or generally like rice, so that didn't do much for me. There were some various meat dishes. I liked the chicken dish best. There were various vegetable dishes as well. I didnt have seconds of anything...it was meh. Service: it wasn't bad and it wasn't great either. They didn't really keep checking in on us or engage with us. These were the issues, the owner talking on the phone while we were eating dinner. It killed the vibe for me. I don't want to hear someones conversation directly next me when I'm eating dinner with my family. We were the only patrons at the time and it was just weird. Also, my kid was playing on one of the steps near a table because we were the only Patrons at the time. A large group walked in and the owner decided to seat them at a table by the step where she was playing with her toys. Instead of waiting for us to gather our things, he proceeded to step over us and have 6 more people step over us as well. This was an issue because they could have stepped on her hands or toys and either she or they would have injured themselves. Also, like I said we were the only people there, it wasn't busy. They really could have waited for us to get up instead of stepping over and around us, extremely rude. Overall: I think this place could be great, if the owners pay attention to details when it comes to customers and food. The only reason I would come back is because of the above mentioned main course.
Fantastic. Haven't had Sri Lankan food this good anywhere in NYC. As part Sri Lankan the bar was set high, but Lakruwana's lamb lamprais was on par with my grandma's. Other highlights included: kale and coconut, chicken curry + string hopper kottu. Amazing spot.
I Ordered the Assorted appetizer which was a mix of fish and Vegetables fried and breaded . It was delicious. I ordered the Godamba roti with beef Curry. Absolutely incredible I highly recommend it.
I really like the food here, but beware.. its very spicy!  the buffet is great but some dishes are too spicy.  But a nice variety. Its decorated beautifully also.. its always very crowded when I've been there, but I always go on weekends.
Super awesome place. The ambiance and decor is super cool, and it's very comfortable. Workers here are quite friendly too. I came with three friends for the buffet, and it was pretty great! There were some rice choices, some vegetable curries as well as some meat curries. The coconut kale was surprisingly good (I don't usually like coconut), but it was really salty. The chicken curry was good and had lots of flavor; this might have been my favorite dish. The black goat curry was quite tasty too but it was also really salty, and it wasn't spicy enough and could have had more flavor. I really liked the red spicy sauce though! The pineapple curry was good but I thought it could have had more flavor as well, and I'm not sure whether the pineapple was fresh. The eggplant was okay, but it was lukewarm when I ate it. The thin crunchy lentil sheet was good but too salty/buttery for me. In general a good selection of foods, but also too salty. The desserts were good! I especially enjoyed the sago and the mango mousse. At $14 pre-tax pre-tip, it's quite cheap for the amount of food you can eat (I kind of wish there were more selections though; I got a two plates to try it all, and then I ate about another two or three plates of the same dishes). The restaurant isn't too far from the Staten Island ferry either, so it's quite easy to get to as well. Street parking if you drive! Cool place.
This rating / review is for the first time I visited Lakruwana. It was a mind-blowing food experience. Some meals change you. This was one of them. I had their lamb biryani, hoppas, and a taste of friend's dishes, all were flavor explosions, many of which I was not familiar with. What a great introduction to Sri Lankan food. Not quite a fan of their lunch buffet, but their biryanis are to die for. What I really mean is, I would abandon all my values and principles to be able to eat their lamb biryani everday for the rest of my life. Decor is like none other. Their menus are special. Make the trip. Get the lamb biryani. Review over.
3.75 stars. I had never had Srilankan food before, until coming here with a group of friends. The place is spectacular... more like a museum that a restaurant. There are artifacts everywhere, and the atmosphere is fantastic. We were served by a welcoming family that did everything they could to make us feel comfortable. We came for dinner, although their weekend brunch is an outstanding deal. I didn't find the food to be as memorable as most other yelpers, but it was good nonetheless. I would totally go back for the brunch. Mango lassi: delicious and very rich. Mulligatawny soup: very delicate; tasty. Lentil soup: interesting snd spicy. Assorted appetizers: 4 croquettes with mixed vegetables and fish... a lil dry. Lamprie with lamb: except for the meat - which was tough and dry - the rest of the dish was very tasty, especially the eggplant...truly delicious. It was an interesting combination of flavors, which I highly recommend. Maybe I wouldn't get the meat next time. Kottu roti with vegetables: very flavorful; a lil too starchy for me, but it's just my preference... the dish was well prepared and presented. Egg hopper with fish: underwhelming. Fish biyriani: just ok; flavors didn't stand up as much as I had expected, and the fish was very dry. Watalappan (coconut custard): not as sweet as I had expected, but still an interesting choice. Overall, it's a solid place, wonderfully managed, and an experience itself just to walk inside.
Best brunch spot in NYC, period.Saturdays and Sundays they serve a buffet for 13.95 that includes 3 kinds of rice, 7 kinds of curries and 5 kinds of dessert. Best part is, the ingredients are fresh and, no matter where you call home, this food tastes like home, because of how flavorful it is.I do think the veggie curries were significantly better than the 2 meat curries that day, which were black pork and devil chicken. The pork especially was dry and overcooked. But the vegetable curries were spot on. My favorites were green beans and yucca. Now for the life of me I did not think i would be able to eat yucca at a sub-$15 buffet. It was cooked tender but still had that firm chew. Best part is, for the first time I actually had yucca that was flavorful.Some dishes were misses. I wasn't a huge fan of the kale but I am glad it was there (hashtag fake health hoe). I also didn't understand the egg curry because it tasted like a plain hard boiled egg to me (The only hard boiled egg that stands above all others is chinese tea egg). Desserts were also well made. Try a bit of each and you'll leave extremely satisfied.The place has a sign saying 1. it's better to eat Sri Lankan food with your hands which I think nobody here does 2. you should keep your buffet time under 1 hour. But honestly I was full after a plate so I didn't go for seconds, neither did the couple sitting next to me. I definitely got the bang for my buck for the entire 30 minutes that I was there. Service was nice. Location is easy to find.
Super delicious Sri Lankan food in a perfect ambiance. Well organized, clean and yummy food. Went to Buffet on Saturday and it was one of the best buffets I have been to.
Been to this place once. Best experience ever there food is so great I love it! Don't regret coming here. Only Siri Lankan place in Staten Island that is worth going to with every penny. No doubt about it.
The interior design and artifacts in itself is amazing. Every detail is focused on (including the carved wooden mask menus and clay pottery water glasses and pitcher). The dishes are served with great attention to esthetics, and flavors are beyond anything I have ever had. I love having foods that go beyond my normal taste bud history; there was so much depth and flavors I had never had together. Meat was tender (pork and chicken), roti was warm and soft, and the side dished were delicious.
I wish there was an option of giving a rating of 3.5, instead of 3. The food at Lakruwana wasn't bad at all, but unfortunately, not memorable at all. My husband and I were really looking forward to dining here. We came all the way from Jersey to Staten Island for a first time Sri Lankan buffet experience. I was a tad disappointed, after reading highly positive reviews of Lakruwana. Mostly what I can remember of the place is the bombardment in terms of decor. So many items on display in a rather small space - earthenware pots, huge wrought iron chairs, masks, signs hanging everywhere (even all over the tiny washroom!),...Really loud decor, both inside the restaurant and outside! In terms of the food, out of all the buffet items, the eggplant curry was quite nice, and so was the deviled chicken. Otherwise, everything was quite alright. Again, nothing memorable. The food didn't seem the most authentic. I have had Sri Lankan food before at Sigiri, and on both occasions, my husband and I savored all the food we had there, especially the crab curry and egg hoppers. Yumm! At Lakruwana though, the focus seems to be on giving customers, sort of a cultural experience with the decor, as well as the museum downstairs, while the food is really toned down in terms of spice and contemporary items like kale coconut stir fry.
Man... I don't even know where to start. We biked here (from Queens!) on a hot Saturday afternoon in hopes of seeing Staten Island. As a native New Yorker, I was pretty embarrassed about the fact that I had never stepped foot in Staten Island before. Thanks to Lakruwana I will DEFINITELY be returning. (By the way - it's a long bike ride, but if you've got it in you, it's worth it. You'll get to sail past the Statue of Liberty for free on the ferry from Manhattan, and after you've eaten your fill, you can casually make your way to South Beach to catch some waves. Lakruwana is only about 10-15 minutes from the SI ferry station by bike.) They had a weekend lunch buffet for $11.95 or something ludicrous. Had I paid double that, I'd still have been pretty happy. There was a large spread of dishes to choose from, kept warm in clay urns. Everything was extremely flavorful and spicy. My bf liked the eggplant especially, which had this caramelized, smokey quality. He also really enjoyed the pork curry, which was a favorite of mine as well. If you're not a huge fan of sweetness like me, you can balance out the sweeter dishes like the eggplant and pineapple curries with the various savory curries, yuca, green beans, daal, pickled vegetables, and salads. They also have a few different chutneys, in case you need more of any flavor (sweetness, sourness, hotness). Afterwards, grab some dessert from the back, in particular the sago. The decor is extravagant and immersive, like the food. Memorable details include the massive Buddha sculpture, the tapestries lining the walls, and narrow-necked clay jugs for holding drinking water. So someone please explain how a place like this, which serves phenomenal food at an equally phenomenal price, can have such beautiful decor? I love Queens, but to be perfectly honest, most of my favorite cheap eats in Queens are holes in the wall. In conclusion, go. Don't think about it, just go.
I came here about 4 times in the evenings with friends and always thought this place was just a neat novelty (the décor is cool) with only so-so Sri Lankan food.  Dosa Garden is consistently much better.  I would have given it 3 stars for the food at that point.But then I finally went to the brunch, and it completely changed my opinion of the place ... brunch really MAKES Lakruwana.  The buffet is way better than just ordering things off the menu--both the quality and the variety of the foods you get.  It's a huge selection, served in an interesting display integrated into the décor (it's easy to miss some of the dishes the first time through), and you quickly find the things you like best.
Well the girls of Sex and the City definitely never came here for brunch. Are you sick of just eating the same old silly pancake and drinking Bloody Marys while you talk about last night's shenanigans?It's time to mix it up! Walking in, you'll feel like you entered a magic portal to Sri Lanka. The interior is INCREDIBLE. Literally everything is imported from Sri Lanka. The walls are made of stone, there are Buddha statues everywhere, and even the menus are pasted on wooden faces. Though it totally looks like Disneyland on crack inside, don't let that discourage you. This is not some cheesy theme restaurant. In fact, after walking past the rather lackluster neighborhood on your way over you'll be thrilled to enter such a well-cared for space.My friend and I came here for the buffet. Which for $13.95 is a steal considering it's all you can eat and all that will get you in most places is an omelette and a drink. There were about 10-15 dishes including kale and coconut, deviled chicken, spicy green beans, egg curry, dal, spicy coconut, eggplant, spicy yucca, plus an array of mousses for dessert. Every single I ate was delicious. I was raised with Indian food and for a long time I figured Sri Lankan food is similar. NOT the case. While somewhat similar, Sri Lankan food definitely stands on its own. Honestly, we just kept eating and eating and eating. 4 hours later we realized we were the last ones standing.It's definitely worth the trek from the other boroughs. BUT I'm subtracting one star because THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY HOPPERS!! What the heck guys??? That's what Sri Lankan breakfast is known for. We couldn't even order one. That made me pretty effing sad. However as my pants were about to burst open, maybe it was a sign from the Universe.
Went down to this pace with my parents and this has to be the best Sri Lanka food I've had in the states hands down.  Can't wait to go back. Try the lamprais.

Fish biyriani: just ok; flavors didn't stand up as much as I had expected, and the fish was very dry. Watalappan (coconut custard): not as sweet as I had expected, but still an interesting choice. Overall, it's a solid place, wonderfully managed, and an experience itself just to walk inside.
Best brunch spot in NYC, period.Saturdays and Sundays they serve a buffet for 13.95 that includes 3 kinds of rice, 7 kinds of curries and 5 kinds of dessert. Best part is, the ingredients are fresh and, no matter where you call home, this food tastes like home, because of how flavorful it is.I do think the veggie curries were significantly better than the 2 meat curries that day, which were black pork and devil chicken. The pork especially was dry and overcooked. But the vegetable curries were spot on. My favorites were green beans and yucca. Now for the life of me I did not think i would be able to eat yucca at a sub-$15 buffet. It was cooked tender but still had that firm chew. Best part is, for the first time I actually had yucca that was flavorful.Some dishes were misses. I wasn't a huge fan of the kale but I am glad it was there (hashtag fake health hoe). I also didn't understand the egg curry because it tasted like a plain hard boiled egg to me (The only hard boiled egg that stands above all others is chinese tea egg). Desserts were also well made. Try a bit of each and you'll leave extremely satisfied.The place has a sign saying 1. it's better to eat Sri Lankan food with your hands which I think nobody here does 2. you should keep your buffet time under 1 hour. But honestly I was full after a plate so I didn't go for seconds, neither did the couple sitting next to me. I definitely got the bang for my buck for the entire 30 minutes that I was there. Service was nice. Location is easy to find.
Super delicious Sri Lankan food in a perfect ambiance. Well organized, clean and yummy food. Went to Buffet on Saturday and it was one of the best buffets I have been to.
Been to this place once. Best experience ever there food is so great I love it! Don't regret coming here. Only Siri Lankan place in Staten Island that is worth going to with every penny. No doubt about it.
The interior design and artifacts in itself is amazing. Every detail is focused on (including the carved wooden mask menus and clay pottery water glasses and pitcher). The dishes are served with great attention to esthetics, and flavors are beyond anything I have ever had. I love having foods that go beyond my normal taste bud history; there was so much depth and flavors I had never had together. Meat was tender (pork and chicken), roti was warm and soft, and the side dished were delicious.
I wish there was an option of giving a rating of 3.5, instead of 3. The food at Lakruwana wasn't bad at all, but unfortunately, not memorable at all. My husband and I were really looking forward to dining here. We came all the way from Jersey to Staten Island for a first time Sri Lankan buffet experience. I was a tad disappointed, after reading highly positive reviews of Lakruwana. Mostly what I can remember of the place is the bombardment in terms of decor. So many items on display in a rather small space - earthenware pots, huge wrought iron chairs, masks, signs hanging everywhere (even all over the tiny washroom!),...Really loud decor, both inside the restaurant and outside! In terms of the food, out of all the buffet items, the eggplant curry was quite nice, and so was the deviled chicken. Otherwise, everything was quite alright. Again, nothing memorable. The food didn't seem the most authentic. I have had Sri Lankan food before at Sigiri, and on both occasions, my husband and I savored all the food we had there, especially the crab curry and egg hoppers. Yumm! At Lakruwana though, the focus seems to be on giving customers, sort of a cultural experience with the decor, as well as the museum downstairs, while the food is really toned down in terms of spice and contemporary items like kale coconut stir fry.
Man... I don't even know where to start. We biked here (from Queens!) on a hot Saturday afternoon in hopes of seeing Staten Island. As a native New Yorker, I was pretty embarrassed about the fact that I had never stepped foot in Staten Island before. Thanks to Lakruwana I will DEFINITELY be returning. (By the way - it's a long bike ride, but if you've got it in you, it's worth it. You'll get to sail past the Statue of Liberty for free on the ferry from Manhattan, and after you've eaten your fill, you can casually make your way to South Beach to catch some waves. Lakruwana is only about 10-15 minutes from the SI ferry station by bike.) They had a weekend lunch buffet for $11.95 or something ludicrous. Had I paid double that, I'd still have been pretty happy. There was a large spread of dishes to choose from, kept warm in clay urns. Everything was extremely flavorful and spicy. My bf liked the eggplant especially, which had this caramelized, smokey quality. He also really enjoyed the pork curry, which was a favorite of mine as well. If you're not a huge fan of sweetness like me, you can balance out the sweeter dishes like the eggplant and pineapple curries with the various savory curries, yuca, green beans, daal, pickled vegetables, and salads. They also have a few different chutneys, in case you need more of any flavor (sweetness, sourness, hotness). Afterwards, grab some dessert from the back, in particular the sago. The decor is extravagant and immersive, like the food. Memorable details include the massive Buddha sculpture, the tapestries lining the walls, and narrow-necked clay jugs for holding drinking water. So someone please explain how a place like this, which serves phenomenal food at an equally phenomenal price, can have such beautiful decor? I love Queens, but to be perfectly honest, most of my favorite cheap eats in Queens are holes in the wall. In conclusion, go. Don't think about it, just go.
I came here about 4 times in the evenings with friends and always thought this place was just a neat novelty (the décor is cool) with only so-so Sri Lankan food.  Dosa Garden is consistently much better.  I would have given it 3 stars for the food at that point.But then I finally went to the brunch, and it completely changed my opinion of the place ... brunch really MAKES Lakruwana.  The buffet is way better than just ordering things off the menu--both the quality and the variety of the foods you get.  It's a huge selection, served in an interesting display integrated into the décor (it's easy to miss some of the dishes the first time through), and you quickly find the things you like best.
Well the girls of Sex and the City definitely never came here for brunch. Are you sick of just eating the same old silly pancake and drinking Bloody Marys while you talk about last night's shenanigans?It's time to mix it up! Walking in, you'll feel like you entered a magic portal to Sri Lanka. The interior is INCREDIBLE. Literally everything is imported from Sri Lanka. The walls are made of stone, there are Buddha statues everywhere, and even the menus are pasted on wooden faces. Though it totally looks like Disneyland on crack inside, don't let that discourage you. This is not some cheesy theme restaurant. In fact, after walking past the rather lackluster neighborhood on your way over you'll be thrilled to enter such a well-cared for space.My friend and I came here for the buffet. Which for $13.95 is a steal considering it's all you can eat and all that will get you in most places is an omelette and a drink. There were about 10-15 dishes including kale and coconut, deviled chicken, spicy green beans, egg curry, dal, spicy coconut, eggplant, spicy yucca, plus an array of mousses for dessert. Every single I ate was delicious. I was raised with Indian food and for a long time I figured Sri Lankan food is similar. NOT the case. While somewhat similar, Sri Lankan food definitely stands on its own. Honestly, we just kept eating and eating and eating. 4 hours later we realized we were the last ones standing.It's definitely worth the trek from the other boroughs. BUT I'm subtracting one star because THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY HOPPERS!! What the heck guys??? That's what Sri Lankan breakfast is known for. We couldn't even order one. That made me pretty effing sad. However as my pants were about to burst open, maybe it was a sign from the Universe.
Went down to this pace with my parents and this has to be the best Sri Lanka food I've had in the states hands down.  Can't wait to go back. Try the lamprais.
