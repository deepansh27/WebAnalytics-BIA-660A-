So thrilled that Han Dynasty is finally in Brooklyn. I've been to the East Village location a handful of times and have never been disappointed. Our go-to order is chicken wings, wontons, cucumbers, and dan dan noodles, all of which are amazing. It's usually one of those dining experiences where we stuff ourselves, then sit around for another 30 minutes until there's enough room to eat one more wonton or one more chicken wing. It really is that good. We stopped by the soft opening of the new Brooklyn location with a group of friends over the weekend, and I'm happy to report that the food is just as excellent. We added some cumin tofu and dry pot beef to the mix, and everybody walked away full and happy. This location hasn't yet worked out it's cocktail menu, but I'm hoping for some of the giant bronze pineapple cocktails to hit the bar soon. The only small hiccup, there was a wait for our table (which was fine, you can grab a beer and meander around the food hall) but the cell reception in the basement is pretty much nil, so I had to keep checking back in with the hostess to make sure we hadn't missed the text for our table. Anyway, a small price to pay. As this place is dangerously close to my apartment, and right downstairs from the Alamo theater, I'm sure we'll be back again and again.
Great meal, reasonable wait. Pea tips with garlic, salt and pepper scallops and wontons in chili oil were especially good.
