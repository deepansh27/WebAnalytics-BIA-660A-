This is the second time that we've been to this restaurant and it's better than the last. But beware the spice is real! Pay attention to those stars. The staff is very friendly and responsive. They were also very accommodating about food restrictions for my vegan dinner guest. The vegetable samosas can be a little doughy but that can be hard to get right. The Ka-chori is super yummy, crisp and flavorful: a nice balance of sweet and a little spice. The Goat Karahi is sooooo scrum-dilli-umptious. I want to try other things but it keeps calling me back. It's a BYOB spot, the waiter tells us. And there's a liquor store down the road if that's your jam. The music is nice in the background but you can still have a decent conversation. We're a fan of this place. We'll def be back.
I ate food here. It's good stuff, I mean, I'm writing now because I wasn't allowed to just say "I ate food here". It's good, it's food, it's good food.
This is by far my favorite restaurant to eat from. The food is always cooked so perfectly and it's seasonings radiate the air with such an alluring scent. The samosas are by far one of the best items to have and always are my first choice. The curry is superb, I'm not sure how many times I've had the chicken curry but I'm always left satisfied with the meal. Definitely a 5 star rating and I strongly recommend people eat here
This place is great - was talking with the manager/owner and turns out he lived in London and ran an Indian place in Brick Lane there for 6 years (and anyone who's familiar with that city's amazing Indian food knows this is a good thing). I believe it--food here is exceptional, better than any of the similarly priced places I've been to in Manhattan.Super friendly, nice atmosphere and great service as well. Highly recommended.
Wow! We walked into an empty restaurant and the waiter greeted us and bought over some popadoms straight away. He explained that they had been very busy with takeout and delivery and had had to stop taking any more orders online. I had the tandoori mix grill. To say this was 5* was an understatement. It came with a huge chicken leg, about 5 chicken pieces with different spices, a couple of pieces of goat (I think?!) and a huge shrimp. It also came with rice (I'll come to that later). The meat was so tender it practically melted. The only negative for me personally was the goat, but just because I'm not a fan of goat normally, not the chef's fault. The flavours of the tandoori were intense and every mouthful got better and better. Even the rice was great on its own, and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually eat rice.My boyfriend had the karahi curry which he also really enjoyed.  It had some good warming heat without being overpowering and the meat again was super tender. After we'd finished our meals and thought we couldn't possibly eat another bite we were brought over some complimentary rice pudding for dessert. This was she perfect pallet cleanser. The whole check including a 20% tip was $40. Would recommend this spot to anyone.
Amazing service and food. They even play indian music videos on the TV in the back which contributes well to the mood and atmosphere in the restaurant. A must try Indian restaurant. They even included some dessert on the house for my girlfriend and I. We will certainly be coming back!
Great classic, simple, and affordable Indian Food - for take-out or dining-in. Try the Chicken Tandoori. BYOB and efficient service are also great pluses.
Excellent food and service! The waiter was super friendly and provided great service! Really enjoyed the butter chicken and my friend had the tikka masala and it was delicious
I'm only reviewing this as a take out order.  I ordered dinner at 10pm and it got here within 40 minutes.  Amazing!  We ordered chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and lamb vindaloo.  I thought the tikka was the worst thing because it was SO sweet, like it straight up tasted like caramelized creamy tomato sauce.  Maybe because they used brown sugar or something?  It was weird.  Vindaloo and saag paneer were awesome though!  I dont' mind that they dodn't give us that much meat, but some might get bugged by it.  Maybe they should just cut their chicken pieces smaller so it seems like you get more... ha.Their RICE is 100X better htan their naan.  I usually want naan when I order because its so good with sauce, but their RICE has so much flavor.  And their naan is pretty mediocre.  It tastes kinda like the store bought type - not that fresh tasting.
Great food, great service, highly recommended!Portions are medium, but priced very fairly. Between two we shared an appetizer of vegetable samosa, then had naan, rice, curry and tikka masala, we were stuffed and still had some leftovers. Everything exceeded our expectations.
The Veg Biryani was a disappointingly bland mass - with limp, flavorless vegetables.  Easily the worst biryani I've ever tasted. Went in the trash. With so many great Indian options in the neighborhood save yourself the bother and go elsewhere.
This place is phenomenal. One of the best saag panir dishes I've ever tasted. Also, amazing customer service. Thanks for such a great dining experience! I'll definitely be back.
I went there for the first time with my gf, and the food was good. The waiter was very friendly and helpful to suggest good food. Try goat curry ( forgot the name of dish ) , but it comes in the sizzling pan.
Excellent, authentic Indian food and very good service. We came here because of very high ratings on Google, we were surprised when the restaurant was not busy, realized soon after that most of their business is delivery.Our server was great, brought papadum with sauces out right away. We ordered samosas and cauliflower apps, the samosas were especially flavorful and the sweet chili sauce on the cauliflower was so good! For entrees we had chana masala, chicken tikka masala, Rogan Josh and chicken korma; all the dishes were flavorful but mild spice level, my next visit I will ask to kick up the spice. After dinner, we were served complimentary rice pudding, unique flavor for kheer, tasted like it included carrot but still sweet.They do not serve any alcohol but you can bring your own.
My wife, my sister, and myself were walking down Grand Street looking for a place to have dinner. We noticed Indian Kitchen and we were immediately drawn to the place. The manager, Monju, welcomed us graciously upon arrival. He guided us through the wide variety of dishes in the menu, and we settled on a goat curry, Daal Samber, and Aloo Zira. All three were delicious! Garlic naan was superb.I have to add that papadam appetizer here is the best I've had. Sounds of Bollywood films complete the atmosphere. Overall, service, food, and ambiance, created a sense of well-being in us. We will surely return to Indian Kitchen.
This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in East Williamsburg. I moved here recently and, of course, one of the most important things to figure out was what foods are near me. First off, I am a huge fan of Indian cuisine. I used to travel really far just for some delicious vegetable samosas and mango lassi, but now I found my new home lol. Indian Kitchen has over 100 dishes freshly cooked by amazing cooks and served by the nicest waiters I have ever met. Everything about Indian Kitchen is beautiful. The music, the atmosphere, and the decor makes you feel like you're warped into a totally different culture and it's a beautiful experience. They show you love and appreciation every time you walk through the door. I've been here like 5 times lol and got a complimentary dessert from the owner (Monju) himself. Overall, I really love Indian Kitchen and I just wanted to show my appreciation through this amazing review ;-)
Really great atmosphere. Even better service!!! Servers make great suggestions especially since it was my first time trying Indian cuisine.  Will absolutely go back!!!!
Indian kitchen is a welcoming place with delicious food all over the menu. I will frequent this restaurant and I will try it all. Home sweet home. They are so kind and careful and pay close attention to their food and their guests. I love Indian kitchen. Thank you!
I'm new to the neighborhood so I don't have a ton of experience with them yet but I LOVE Indian Kitchen. They have consistently good food--I tend to get the one appetizer, one entree, and naan special. Most recently I ordered chicken tikka masala which I asked for a little spicy. I'm not sure if that's possible but it tasted a little extra complex and was great either way. For my appetizer I am totally blanking on the name but it was a cold dish of maybe chickpeas, potatoes, and toasted naan in raita? No idea what it was but it was fabulous and a great compliment to the tikka masala.As good as the food is, the real gem here is the staff. They have THE BEST service and have turned me into a loyal customer as a result. If you can make it into the restaurant, DO IT. I think they do a lot of takeout orders so it's not normally packed but in my experience it just means you get fantastic service (and I believe they give a dine-in discount!). I tend to get my food to go--I love eating on my couch, what can I say--but I always go pick it up myself because they are such a pleasure. So glad I've found these guys!
Some of the best Indian I've had, straight up home cooking. I recommend the yellow tarka Dal if you're a vegetarian, can't go wrong with anything on this menu at all. The owner couldn't be more accommodating.
My favorite Indian place!!! And I can be pretty picky when it comes to Indian food, but this place is constantly amazing. I'm also Vegan and they're always very accommodating. I come here at least once a week I love it so much. The server Monzu is always an absolute pleasure. Definitely a must try
Danger, this made me sick. Super no bueno. My roomie is lucky he's out of town, once I stop sweating I can clean the bathroom. Waste of money and "food."
Customer service horriblePlaced an order at 5:45 it's now 7:35 and instill have not received my food...  I did not get a call until 7 from them saying it's gonna take long for the order. The fact that I feel asleep waiting for my food I didn't feel the wait so much but now I'm awake and have called 3 times and all they are saying is they are sorry and it's going to take 10min, then another 10min, and another 10min...
I was the only customer on a recent Saturday afternoon, having a late lunch before heading off to a dinner party. In daylight, the interior is bland and inoffensive, a bit disappointing considering this place just opened. The menu is very long and organized by protein. I'm getting sick of these huge, impossible to navigate lists of food. I know they are staples of takeout-heavy Asian cuisine, but they make ordering such a chore. Most people are forced to either stick to a small set of favorites or randomly wander through entrees.There's no way to tell what a restaurant does particularly well, or uneven where they might specialize. So it is at Indian Kitchen, where my chicken korahi was perfectly serviceable. And the naan I ordered to accompany it was quite nice. But there's nothing particularly memorable about this place. Indian Kitchen is stuck in an uncomfortable middle position. There's more interesting and expensive food to the west in Williamsburg and in Curry Hill, while there are cheaper, more spicy options downtown and in Queens. Indian Kitchen isn't as good as either of these; it's only true virtue is its location.
I love it here!!! Monzu is amazing. He is extremely welcoming, hospitable, attentive and sweet. The food is phenomenal. The mango lassi delicious. This is by far the best indian restuarant in Williamsburg. I will be back real soon.
Really enjoyed the food and very very good service on Friday night. BYOB encouraged (they open bottle for you and provide wine glasses). Not expensive either. Highly recommend!
Tl;dr: The service was incredible, but I wasn't super impressed with the food. Good for takeout. The food: We had the vegetable samosas, garlic and onion naan, paneer matar, goat saag, and the rice pudding. The chutneys at this place are solid. The samosas had paneer, which is sort of unusual, and were average. The naan was more dense than fluffy, but had a good amount of garlic and onion. The paneer matar had good overall flavor, but the peas tasted like they had been frozen, and the paneer was not very fresh. My partner really enjoyed the goat saag. The rice pudding was the best part - I'm not huge on Indian desserts because they're usually too sweet for me, but this was delicious and balanced and creamy and they gave it to us on the house! The place: pretty empty, I think most people order take out. Loud-ish Indian music, well lit, good seats near window. The score: I would have given it a 2 for food, a 4.5 for service, a 3 for vibes. Gave it an overall 3 because my partner really enjoyed his food.
I love this place! I order at least once a week. The lamb saag delish, it comes with basmati rice, an appetizer & fixins (13.95) not bad at all. They arrive within 20 minutes of my order being placed. Wonderful!
Well, the rice and breads are good, but those items alone don't make a meal, do they? I was actually quite surprised by how bland or off-flavor the dishes were. The lamb tikka masala was excessively sweet and not creamy. Sauce was thick, but not savory in flavor. It tasted more like a sweet and sour sauce or fancy ketchup. Meat was dry. The vegetable samosas were dull, both inside and out. The aloo saag was as bland as they come. I truly did not understand what I was eating. The service was good though, which is why I'm sad to give a bad review. Our server (possibly the owner or manager) was attentive and kind. We were the only people in the restaurant though, so I wouldn't expect anything less. Looks like the bulk of their business comes from deliveries. Helmet man came in and out a few times during our meal. I wish I can say I'd go back to give them a second try, but the dishes were so unsatisfying, I don't have anything to work with to take that chance.
Really bland greedy food. I ordered the tandoori chicken, coconut samosas, parkora, and lamb curry. It was all bad. And we didn't receive any utensils to eat with or napkins.
I recently went to Indian Kitchen with a friend for dinner. It's a lovely little spot: the ambiance is really nice. Our waiter was friendly and inviting, he made sure to check in frequently. My chicken biryani was really flavourful. I'm really glad to have found this place and will definitely return!
Really good Indian. Always gets delivered quickly and the customer service is good. Pretty solid Indian food. Warning: MEDIUM spicy is not really medium. It leans more towards the spicy side. But I love spicy so it's great. It's my go to Indian spot in the neighborhood.
Very good value for their lunch special - lots of food and a drink for not much money. Employee also chased me down after I forgot my bag! Only flaw - tomato/lentil soup isn't great (strong ketchupy flavor) so get the salad inste
Loved this place! So sweet, the server was really friendly and the atmosphere was really great for my date. It was warm and felt homie with the beautiful dishes. Will come again!
So I just moved to this neighborhood and my friend and I wanted indian food. The food was so great and the staff was so nice. I ordered a mango lassi which was great. They put whipped cream on top which I have not seen before but it was awesome. The atmosphere is very calm and relaxing. Good for a dinner date but casual. I ordered the Paneer tikka masala and it had the perfect kick to it. If you want spicy, tell them and they will make it spicier. The waiter was very nice and did not rush us. We also go complimentary dessert which was okay but honestly I am not a fan of indian dessert, but still a nice gesture. I went back by myself two weeks later because I was craving it. I want to go again right now. Also they delivery. Highly recommend overall but wear a coat. I went this past week and the delivery guy kept coming in and out of the restaurant and I felt like I was outside so not good on a cold night to go here.
good but not great. i ordered delivery on their website. food came promptly and still hot despite it being a rainy day. i got the paneer tikka masala which was really good but the chicken korma was so bland and boring! disappointed. rice was also overcooked and mushy but i liked the papadom. the biryani looks good from the pics but who knows!
Everything we ordered was delicious and they bring you a dessert at the end that was great. Solid YouTube playlist. Definitely recommend!
The food and service were amazing!!!! The rice puddling was to die for!!!! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Brooklyn!!!
Best Indian restaurant in Williamsburg! Don't go anywhere else. Indian Kitchen blows the other Indian restaurants out of the water. Chicken Tikka Marsala was fabulous!
Good food, but apparently you only get one fork with every order. I ordered 3 entres. They took 40 minutes to bring me more forks.
Hands down the best Indian restaurant in Brooklyn! Also very reasonably priced. I have had Indian food in New Zealand, Australia, all across the US and this place has not been beat! Great customer service and great ambiance.
I have been searching for a good Indian food place that delivers and this is the place! I've had it a few times now. Other than the occasional too salty samosa, the food is absolutely delicious! Always hot when delivered and they never forget things, except utensils.
They just opened this week and I'm already a fan! The size of the place is substantial, the decor is pretty and the tables are very nicely spaced (meaning your elbows aren't bumping into the next table!) and the staff is very welcoming from the moment you enter. Appetizers were vegetarian Samosas (potato/veg), Banana Pakora (banana fritters) and Shrimp Pakora (deep fried shrimp & onion rings) .. all were delicious and the samosas were happily larger than I expected. Dinner was Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer (cream spinach/cheese) and Vegetable Tikka Masala, came with a nice sized basmati rice. The flavors were great, the sauce was lip smacking and I was impressed with how very fresh everything tasted. The garlic na-an came out piping hot and was ridiculously delish! I noticed take out orders were definitely in full swing.. in the hour I was there both delivery guys kept a constant rotation of in/out in/out with various bags in hand each time. Prices were decent.. not dirt cheap but not expensive either... for the meal above it came out to 64ish and change.. again.. not bad at all and well worth every penny! I for one will be going back..
This is not even remotely good Indian. Someone is heavy handed with sugar. Everything tastes sugary. The sauces on the side were all sweet. The tikka masala I asked to be extra spicy was just sweet and the $3 tiny cucumber yogurt I got on the side tasted like it was made with vanilla yogurt. Ew. Portions weren't bad. And the lamb was very tender, but the flavors were awful. Having lots of strikes with Indian in NYC.
Excellent food. Amazing service. My son ate the goat curry which he said it was fantastic. Daughter ate chick peas and spinach which was delicious.  Highly recommend this cozy restaurant! Monzu's service was phenomenal!!!
This place was wonderful! A friend and I went here for Williamsburg's Grand Street Restaurant Week. Their dinner deal was an appetizer, entree, dessert, and naan for only $10. Ridiculously good price for such tasty food! I ordered a Somosa for an appetizer (A+) and the Masala Korahi with lamb (A++). We also had a very nice and attentive waiter. Overall a really great experience! I would definitely go back and recommend it.
One of the best and most authentic Indian restaurant in Brooklyn.I came here with my friend,we order chicken tikka ( the chicken tikka was sizzling and perfect cooked)Nice flavor and tasty,we also order lamb curry and fish masala and garlic nan,it was delicious,We are so happy for delicious food.Lovely people excellent food and service.Thanks Indian kitchen
Great food, sweet staff and always consistent. Get the mango lassi!!! I've always gotten the Rogan Josh and Dal Makni (my spelling is bad!). They make most of their business in delivery so it gets busy but it's worth the wait!
Ordered from these guys Saturday night, it took more than an hour and a half to get to us and the food was cold. I called an hour in and was rudely told they tried to call me (my phone was with me the whole time, full service, there was no call). They were not apologetic, food was cold and honestly very sugary for my taste (panir masala, mango lassi).
every time i come here, they are always so accommodating and kind. they genuinely care about the business and the people that walk in-- the best kind of businesses.
Great dining and culinary experience- I simply love the atmosphere and location. They are casual but fine and yet provide food with great comfort and precision. The Rogan Josh and Biryani are a staple - washed down with a Lassi!
Good simple indian restaurant. They have all the usual options and the service is attentive.It's BYOB.
Great restaurant! Monzou was my waiter. He was great and when we got to know him he treated us really nice. Definitely gonna check this out again if I'm in the neighborhood. My aloo Gobi was great and the nan was too. Check out the rice pudding dessert.
Super good and fast. Great veggie dishes. Quick delivery and very nice folks on the phone. Discount for phone in and cash. Word
Consistantes fast, consistently good service, consistently delicious. We come here a lot, sometimes done in, often takeout. They're very friendly, almost always give extras like papadum and/or rice pudding to finish the meal, and will make recommendations if you ask. We've loved everything we've had.
This place is lucky I can't leave a zero review. I ordered delivery on 7-30-16 and not only was my order wrong they refused to correct it. They said they were too busy to do anything about it. The delivery time was atrocious too 1 1/2 hrs for food and it was wrong. They said they would re deliver the food but they lied about that too. Freaking horrible experience. Too busy to correct their mistake??? Wtf is that. Then they refused to refund my money. This place sucks and the food tastes like freezer Indian food from bjs. Don't waste your time or money.
Monju the restaurant owner for new management goes above and beyond the call of duty. Indian Kitchen is one of the few exceptional places that opens late in the neighborhood, very convenient. I am usually not a big Indian food fan, but nevertheless, the restaurant serves consistent good qualify food that I have come to enjoy.
FOUND A FAKE NAIL IN MY FOOD, NEVER EAT HERE!! I ordered seamless takeout from Indian Kitchen last night and half way through my paneer, I bit into a long artificial nail that was in my food. I've never been so grossed out. A) They clearly have low standards for sanitary food preparationB) Who are their cooks that lose fake nails while they're cooking and don't have the morals to do the right thing and scrap the food and start over?Look, I'm still gagging just thinking about this. I called the restaurant and let them have it.Spare yourselves what I went through.Don't. Eat. here.
Had the chicken tikka masala delivered at work today. It exceeded my expectations. It was fantastic the portion was enough for 2 meals. I will be ordering from them again!
I went in for lunch because of the 25% off dine-in only special they had posted outside. Food was just okay. I got charged full price because what I ordered - the goat curry lunch special - was "already discounted." FOUL PLAY! I would have just ordered the normal goat curry entree instead of the special which came with plain bread and a soup, both which didn't really add to the meal. Of note: The guy working the register/waiter was clipping his nails throughout my lunch. I was the only one in here the entire time I was in, so the clipping sound was very audible and gross.
Came with a big group, very accommodating, gracious and food came out in a timely manner. All the staff were very polite, didn't mind our bad behavior. Come with friends!
Indian kitchen is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in the area. They have 25% off lunch and 20% off dinner. They also do byob and have wifi. I love their chicken tikka masala and their Bombay aloo dishes. Also their garlic naan and paratha bread is amazing. I come here often and also order delivery all the time.
One of the good Indian places I've been to in a while. Check out the Paneer dishes and the cheese naan. They are super good. The place in under a new management and the manager is a chilled out guy. The ambience fits in with the food and the service. Overall, a place to get good indian food.
Today I tried some new items of this Restaurant.. 1) Red Sniper Tandoori 2) Tandoori Mix Grill & 3) Lamb Biryani. Everything was So Awesome n Delicious. I just want to say the best Indian Food that I ever had... Soooo Yuuuummmmiiiii......
Delicious. The food is perfectly authentic. The service was wonderfully attentive. Couldn't recommend more.
I love indian food. I tried many indian restaurants in Williamsburg and found this one better than any other i went to. They make the best chicken masala and their bread tastes really good. Overall the best indian restaurant in Williamsburg area
My girlfriend and I have been here multiple times and we keep coming back for more.  The samosas are so damn good!  When we first used to go there, they were pretty dry.  Now, they are so moist and delicious.  I can eat 4 of those them.  We always get the "vegetable jalfrezi" (forgive me for incorrect spelling.)  It was great!  The sauce was nice and spicy and the vegetables were cooked to perfection.  This dish was exquisite.  The tikka masala was okay.  The chicken and rice were cooked well, but the curry sauce wasn't so good.  I felt it needed more cream.Our servers were always nice and respectful.  They got the order right every time.The restaurant itself was extremely clean and beautifully decorated.  I love the atmosphere in this restaurant.  From the flowers on the tables, to the Bollywood music videos playing on a flat screen television, this place always makes me feel great.And last but not least, the prices.  The prices honestly are really, really good.  If you want some authentic Indian dishes for a decent price, then come to the Indian Kitchen!I need to try the other dishes on the menu!  This place will always be my favorite.
This place has terrible food - I'm genuinely surprised at the good reviews. I've had my fair share of Indian food and this place is as bad as I've ever had. To begin with, the naan was not good. It got cold very quickly and became dry. Not fluffy as naan should be. Appetizers were probably the highlight. We had gobi manchurian and chicken kebabs. These tasted "normal" at least. Entrees is where it all went downhill. We got chicken makhani, saag paneer, baingan bharta. Of the three, only the baingan bharta was passable. The chicken was shredded, not chunky pieces and the sauce was too thick and too sweet. It did not taste like any chicken Makhani I've ever had. Pretty disgusting. I had one spoon and left the rest untouched. The saag paneer was only slightly better. It had a weird sweet flavor. Usually I love this dish and eat a lot of it. I also only had a spoon and didn't want anymore. Words cannot describe how awful this food was. I usually devour Indian food and here I could barely swallow it. Never going back even though it's so close! I do wonder if their take out is any better. We dined in. Not that I'll bother as there are other options nearby that are way way better.Extra star for the space and accommodating service.
Forget the long dragged out 'Anthony Bourdain-like' review or discussing poor food quality. This review is strictly on good service vs bad. I've ordered from this 'location' three times under three seperate names. It appears whoever owns the realestate keeps having a go at the restaurant business...never relenting to the fact that it may not be the name but the food and service. My review is simple, after a night of heavy rain and winds, I thought it best to order in like most Brookln-ers do under inclement weather. I ordered at 8:15pm and did not receive a confirmation that the food was in the works until 8:21pm. From that point on there was no communication and it was only after 9:45pm when the delivery time expired that I thought it best to call. Turns out that my food would be delivered at 10:05pm...I mean when you live 3 blocks away maybe I should've sacked up and just gone there myself. Still after you pay a respectable tip (22% on tax), you'd think a little sympathy for taking almost 2 hours to delivery would be complimentary. Not all at all, and their knowing that I was going to write this review were completely unaffected.Whether the food is good or bad...I'm still writing this review, still waiting for those mysterious mimosas and chick malai kabob to arrive. A hope, a dream, a prayer...a ring of the doorbell would be nice!
Excellent and very authentic Indian food! We love the Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka Masala, and the Saag Paneer. We always order from here for large groups and Indian Kitchen never disappoints! So delish!
I have ordered for chicken tikka masala,vegetable samosa,garlic naan and mango lassi.. food was more than my expectation and they were so delicious.  and got delivery in 35 minutes that was pretty fast
Very good curry, always a great meal. Love the tikka masala!! Very good service, good food, great naan bread, always cater to my preferences!!
Best Indian food in North Brooklyn. Best service anywhere ever! Everything was fresh and seasoned to perfection. An extensive menu with items that were new to me! We left feeling like family.
Was there for the opening night of the restaurant, so for once had no reviews to go by. I was totally blown away. I hope it's always like this. It turns out that this is the 5th place opened by the management, I've been to 2 or 3 of their other places, and one of the staff even recognized me, so I guess I've gotten around,  so just call me an Indian food Ho.Appetizers-so many choices. Aloo-Tika-very high end, as I've come to expect from their other places. Ka -Chori-WINNER!!, a highlight! never had anything like that before, plus the menu describing it as "too difficult to put into words but highly recommended" perfectly captured it. Papadum- usually don't pay for this at most Indian places, but can't have my Indian fix without it, plus they brought more than double of what is usually given.Mushroom soup.-First time I had it, not a mushroom fan, still glad I ordered  it!Main Dishes- since i was there with another, I had the meat dish and they got the vegetarian. The vegetarian was an Eggplant Curry, I'm not into eggplant but really liked this.It was a snowy night (for march 20th!) so decided to go for something sizzling "Lamb Boti Kabob". It comes to your table smoke a blazing, and spreading it's succulent smells throughout the restaurant, and it does not disappoint in the least. If you like to be showy get this.If it wasn't such an unseasonal night I would've definitely had a cold desert or drink. There were many choices of drinks that I had never even heard of that sounded very interesting. It's great that an Indian place exists that has food/beverage choices I've never heard of, especially when they sound so intriguing.The service was very accommodating and the atmosphere was better than at their other venues. The decor didn't blow me away but at least it was not overdone It was roomy and not crowded (Which may not be the case soon, especially if people know a good thing when they see it, and a good thing is NOT the other Indian places on Grand.) The only downside in atmosphere is you'd better like Bollywood, or ask them to turn it down as excerpts are played constantly.The prices are not bargain basement here, but they are not outrageous either, I was happy to see they have 25% off Lunch deals, with lunch being the same size as the dinners. (too many other places downsize for Lunch).Can't wait to be back, hoping everything stays what it was opening night-AMAZING!!
I stumbled upon this restaurant walking down Grand and had an amazing time.  Indian Food is all about chicken in sauces..so we got chicken in the spiciest sauces they had (we asked, they gave).  The price of the food is cheap yet very good, and amazing service.  The waiter was the nicest guy who made sure we were happy with our meal.  They don't serve alcohol but are cool to allow you to bring your own beer, wine, or liquor in!  Pretty awesome!  Super chill!  They gave us a rice pudding w/ cinnamon desert on the house.  I'll come back!
Oh man. When here order the Bharta. Indian style Fire Roasted Eggplant. One of the most amazings Ive ever had in my life. Most people order takeout or delivery, but if you sit and eat-in, the wait staff is super friendly and really attentive, sometimes even giving you some starters on the house if theyre slow. Gone under new management recently, so theyre hoping to revamp their image. They have some great unknown specialities too, if youre looking for something other than Makhani or tikka masala.
The food is pretty decent. Not sure how fresh their ingredients are but nonetheless. However, the food would be even better if it was in fact delivered warm. The delivery service has been consistently between 15 and 25 minutes late and it's been cold almost every time. So, maybe go for pick up or just eat at the place. The food is a decent 3.5 out of 5.
I ordered online through yelp and eat24, which is always amazing and convenient. I noticed they had a special which was 1 entree and an appetizer for $14 which I was hella excited about because $14 is still a STEAL! Especially when the order comes with naan AND rice! Have I gone to heaven?! ****im writing this review as I'm waiting for my food**** which I only ordered 15 minutes ago. I got lamb curry as my entree but I was kinda annoyed that the app didn't askHow spicy I wanted it so I hope it doesn't kill my taste buds being too spicy! ForThe appetizer I ordered chicken kebab.****30 minutes*** IM SO HUNGRY WHERE IS THE FOOOOOOOOD?!(Estimated time is 45-60 mins, so I'm just being dramatic/hungry/bored)***35 mins***Reading all the yelp reviews for this place, and they seem good! Also, I just realized they just opened, which makes sense to why the great deal.. On my $14 meal :) I ain't mad about it yaaaalll! ***42 minutes***MY FOOODS HERE!!No silver wear :( the chicken kebab was good, but not what I expected hah, the naan bread was HEAVEN! So warm and fluff holy shit! The lamb curry has so much oil on top of it which means it's going to be so fucking gooood! Holy spicy!!! It's actually still really hot, so props guys! I could actually feel my arteries clogging from the oil in the lamb curry.And they were like 6 different sauces that I didn't use :/ I feel wasteful ha.The rice is bomb, but you can't really screw that up. I might order from here again.
Food is okay ..that's itNot really into Indian Food(love Basmati rice tho lol)Kinda expensive too Oh yea.. I ordered the Curry Tilapia
The food tastes great!  Finding a hair twice in my food and seeing their "C" health grade is less great.
Had a great dinner here the other night.  Food was fantastic, the butter chicken was legit and had a spicy lamb dish that was recommended to us similar to vindaloo that was amazing.   Our server was as nice and informative as they come.  Will definitely be back.
The rating is for the yellow dal and the missing stars are for the quantity of soap I had to use to get the food color off my hand, the "sweetness" of the watered down spicy green  chutney, the (lack of) quantity of rice in take-out. The area has better choices for Indian food.
Best Indian food. To be honest, I had had an issue once with delivery as month ago. When I complained to management, they were beyond helpful. Ordered today and found out they have new management, monzu was the main guys name, and now have 10 people helping with deliveries. My order got to me immediately. I just hate trolls complaining about great places, and I can't Reccomend this enough! Enjoy!
Always delicious and the best food in my hood. They give great portion sizes . I order delivery from here often and it is always amazing. This is probably one of the best Indian food I have ever had. Definitely I will order again
I've never been to India or had a friend's Indian mother cook me dinner. But I have lived in the UK for four years, where Indian food has a similar status to Chinese food in the U.S. What you get at Indian Kitchen is similar to high-quality British Indian food. Very tasty.
My husband and I were craving Indian food, and found this place online. We weren't expecting much, but were so pleasantly surprised by the experience overall; the food was delicious, the service was excellent and the value was incredible. It seems like they do a ton of delivery business, but it was really nice to sit down and have a great meal in a fun and kitschy environment with great service. We'll definitely be back.
The food is delicious, they catered the spiciness exactly to what we could handle. The ambience is nice, the staff is incredibly friendly and makes great recommendations. The server quickly became our friend. I will come back to eat more delicious food. You should too.
This place just came under new management and it is now awesome! The new manager Monzu is friendly and has made this place the best Indian restaurant in Williamsburg. Seriously check this place out and try the butter chicken. PS you might want to skip lunch the portion sizes here are large even for an Indian place.
Wow, they just delivered my order 75 minutes late and cold.  When I called the restaurant to find out what was going on, they hung up on me. What a mistake to order from them. Never again.
I order from these guys a lot and though occasionally the spiciness can be inconsistent (I like things spicy and sometimes it will come mild) they are a very nice business and care about what they do. Delivery is fast.There was some confusion about an item with my order (which was my misunderstanding) but they remained patient and fixed the problem quickly, much appreciated.
Bull shit resturant with all fake food running it by Indian name where there is no Indian who runs the show..Or work in kitchen..they deserve 0 star or may be MINUS star
Perhaps I need to try this place again and order something different; however, it certainly wasn't anything special from my delivery experience today. It started with the delivery man. He must've been having a really bad day because he wasn't at all friendly and seemed super irritated. I won't hold that against him though because I know his job is pretty stressful. My all time favorite Indian dish is the vindaloo. I usually prefer lamb vindaloo over chicken, because lamb is one of my favorite meats. I ordered online their lamb vindaloo combo special, specified AS SPICY AS POSSIBLE, level 20/10, meaning... if you think it will kill me, it's probably good. One of the biggest reasons why I OBSESS over Indian cuisine is that they know how to make food TRULY spicy. Not "tabasco" spicy or buffalo sauce spicy, I'm talking FIERY, burning, most-people- cannot-handle-type of spicy. Nevertheless, my dish was probably edible for anyone. I'd say level 3-4/10. Also, it didn't taste like vindaloo to me. The sauce was very orange rather than a deep, maroonish red that I'm used to. It was just okay. Not too impressive. The naan was super thick and also not what I'm familiar with, however it was also okay.. I would say the best part of the meal was the samosa. The mango lassi was also delicious. Overall, the place is definitely worth trying again, perhaps inside the actual restaurant. Their prices are more than reasonable, portions are extremely generous, and I'm sure some of their other specialties may be better than what I had ordered. Perhaps if I tell the chef personally that I need my food spicy enough to be a nuclear bomb in my mouth, it will actually happen that way.
food was over an hour late and cold, except for the ice cream which was completely melted. never again.
Delicious food.  Very welcoming and accommodating staff.  I had two apps, an entree and dessert.  They were all really tasty and I will definitely be back!
I ordered the lamb curry meal on christmas night. They delivered the food in 20 minutes! Also unlike the other indian restaurants, the lamb curry actually had enough meat in it. Will def order food from them again :)
Yay! Finally some good Indian food in Williamsburg. The Alu Papri and Chicken Tikka Masala were delicious. And such big portions! Delivery was really quick. I also like that they give you so many different sauces with your order (there were five or six!)
Pretty average indian restaurant (which means that its awesome) but was surprised and disappointed with their palak paneer which was more like a coconut soup than a curry. Still good but not what I was expecting and probably would not order it again. My boyfriend for lamb and said it was amazing so I am sure their other dishes are great. Their naan was awesome too. BYOB is also a plus.
Got delivery and FINALLY the indian restaurant I've been waiting for in greenpoint/williamburg. Eveything was super fresh and the daily special is one heck of a deal. Panir was on point and the okra curry was also on point. All condiments were delicious and naan was perfect. Everything came super hot and delivery was quick. They have my favorite thing ever in gobi manchurian so will def be trying that next. Either way, so stoked to finally have a really legit indian offering!
