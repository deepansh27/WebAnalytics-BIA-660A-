well stocked store..avg variety of indian groceries and hot food. The customer service is bad, the guy in the counter(cashier during noon) was busy digging his phone when people are waiting in line to check out and we had to call him out to bill and pay the money.Better service and collection in jsq.
Conveniently located!!! The vegetarian food is amazing. Better than some of the indian restaurants around the area. The Dal tadka & Bhindi is delicious...& they deliver!
This little indian deli in jersey city is really good indian food for take out. We usually go there once or twice a week for groceries/take out food is really good, try bhindi masala or navratan kurma or anything else. Everything here is really good, made to order and the uncle on the counter is really friendly as well. Do try this place if you haven't , I am sure you will like it.
If you are looking to satisfy your taste buds with awesome Indian food, order from Prime food. They have a limited menu but what they do they do very tasty. Prices are on little higher side for few of the menu items though. You cannot dine in there. The bottom line us Great taste!
